{\large First scientific press:\newline}
 
 \begin{itemize}


 \item 1450: Printing Press (in europe)
 \item 1534: Foundation of Cambridge University Press
   %Foundation of Cambridge University Press, the oldest university press and publishing house in the world
 \item 1665: \textit{Journal des Sçavans} (France), \textit{Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society} (UK)\\
   %Creation of Le Journal des Sçavans in France, the first academic journal. Soon after, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society appears in the UK. It still exists today[5]. The familiar functions of the scientific journal –registration, certification, dissemination, and archiving– are already present[6]
 \end{itemize}

 \vfill
{\large Yet defined the purpose of scientific journals:\newline}

\begin{itemize}
\item registration: authorship/priority claim
\item certification: usually peer-review
\item dissemination: provide (targeted) access
\item archiving: permanent access link (citable)

 \titleframe{Author and Copy rights}\vskip1cm%
\begin{itemize}

 \item 1710: \textit{Statute of Anne}: British authors can control the copying of their books 
   % Royal assent to the Statute of Anne. The British authors are granted the right to control the copying of their books. The duration of copyright is 14 years(renewable once), after which the books enter the public domain[7]. This new regime follows a period of censorship and monopoly(by the Stationer’s Company) and a period of no regulation, which called for a new licensing protecting the authors
 \item 1852: articles published (in FR/UK) can be freely reprinted and translated (unless reserved rights are explicitly mentioned)
   % Signature of a bilateral treaty between the UK and France: all articles published abroad in periodicals can be freely reprinted and translated, unless reserved rights are explicitly mentioned[8]
 \item Foundation of Nature (1869) and Elsevier (1880)
   %Foundation of the British scientific journal Nature[9]
 %1880: Foundation of the Dutch publishing company Elsevier[10]
 \item 1886: Berne Convention governing copyright: grants a CC BY licence by default.%Signature of the Berne Convention, an international agreement governing copyright. Its article 7 states: “Articles from newspapers or periodicals published in any of the countries of the Union may be reproduced in original or in translation in other countries of the Union, unless the authors or publishers have expressly forbidden it.” [11] In today’s parlance, the Berne Convention grants a CC BY licence by default.

 \item 1908: Berlin Act reverses the standards: reproduction implicitly forbidden. %1908: Berlin Act: revision of the Berne Convention. It reverses the standards: instead of being implicitly allowed, reproduction is now implicitly forbidden. Its article 9 states: “Serial stories, tales, and all other works, whether literary, scientific, or artistic, whatever their object, published in the newspapers or periodicals of one of the countries of the Union, may not be reproduced in the other countries without the consent of the authors.” The Berne convention has later been further updated, but this restriction remains. Most countries have now signed it [11].
 \item 1928: Rome Act: author’s rights $\neq$ copyright
   %1928: Rome Act: revision of the Berne Convention. The article 6bis states: “Independently of the author’s copyright, and even after transfer of the said copyright, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work, as well as the right to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the said work which would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation.”. This implements the moral rights of the authors, which is an essential feature of the author’s rights or droit d’auteur, as opposed to the copyright.

\begin{itemize}

 \item 1951: Pergamon Press (now \textbf{Elsevier}) and R. Maxwell: many new thematic journals
   %1951: Robert Maxwell creates Pergamon Press. Academic journals used to be mainly owned by learned societies. Maxwell perceives the potential huge profitability of academic publishing as the public funding for research rises. He creates many new journals for specific fields of research and surfs on globalisation with grand titles like ‘International Journal of’. Pergamon Press is sold to Elsevier in 1991. [13]
 \item 1955: appearance of \textbf{impact factor}
   % The idea of an impact factor is first mentioned by Eugene Garfield in Science. It was originally thought of as a tool for librarians to identify journals to purchase, not as a measure of the quality of research [14]. Since 1975, it has been computed and published in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), nowadays owned by Clarivate [15].
 \item 1970s: rise of journals subscriptions $\Rightarrow$ emerging crisis
   % Beginning of the serials pricing crisis: the prices of subscriptions to scholarly journals rise tremendously. For instance, between 1973 and 1987, the average price increases by 12\% per year, while the costs for the publishers only rise increase by 8\% [16, p. 22]. This difference between expenses and revenue enables the publishers to make big margins. Librarians start to organise and fight back.
 \item 1991: creation free archive \textit{xxx.lanl.gov} at Los Alamos National Laboratory (to become \textbf{arXiv.org}).
% Paul Ginsparg creates the free archive xxx.lanl.gov at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which will become arXiv.org 10 years later [17].
\item By 1994, three years after acquiring Pergamon, Elsevier had raised its prices by 50\%. Librarians began cancelling subscriptions to less popular journals.

S. Buranyi, \textit{Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science?}, The Guardian (2017)\\
{\tiny \url{https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science}}

%Scientists are well aware that they seem to be getting a bad deal. The publishing business is “perverse and needless”, the Berkeley biologist Michael Eisen wrote in a 2003 article for the Guardian, declaring that it “should be a public scandal”. Adrian Sutton, a physicist at Imperial College, told me that scientists “are all slaves to publishers. What other industry receives its raw materials from its customers, gets those same customers to carry out the quality control of those materials, and then sells the same materials back to the customers at a vastly inflated price?” (A representative of RELX Group, the official name of Elsevier since 2015, told me that it and other publishers “serve the research community by doing things that they need that they either cannot, or do not do on their own, and charge a fair price for that service”.)


Randy Schekman: “Despite my giving sermons all over the world on this topic, it seems journals hold sway even more prominently than before. It is that influence, more than the profits that drove the system’s expansion, that most frustrates scientists today.“

 Elsevier says its primary goal is to facilitate the work of scientists and other researchers. An Elsevier rep noted that the company received 1.5m article submissions last year, and published 420,000; 14 million scientists entrust Elsevier to publish their results, and 800,000 scientists donate their time to help them with editing and peer-review. “We help researchers be more productive and efficient,” Alicia Wise, senior vice president of global strategic networks, told me. “And that’s a win for research institutions, and for research funders like governments.”


 guardian:

 Whatever the fate of Sci-Hub, it seems that frustration with the current system is growing. But history shows that betting against science publishers is a risky move. After all, back in 1988, Maxwell predicted that in the future there would only be a handful of immensely powerful publishing companies left, and that they would ply their trade in an electronic age with no printing costs, leading to almost “pure profit”. That sounds a lot like the world we live in now.
