 \titleframe{History of edition}\vskip1cm%

 \begin{itemize}
 \item 1534: Foundation of Cambridge University Press, the oldest university press and publishing house in the world
 \item 1665: Creation of Le Journal des Sçavans in France, the first academic journal. Soon after, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society appears in the UK. It still exists today[5]. The familiar functions of the scientific journal –registration, certification, dissemination, and archiving– are already present[6]
 \item 1710: Royal assent to the Statute of Anne. The British authors are granted the right to control the copying of their books. The duration of copyright is 14 years(renewable once), after which the books enter the public domain[7]. This new regime follows a period of censorship and monopoly(by the Stationer’s Company) and a period of no regulation, which called for a new licensing protecting the authors
 \item 1852: Signature of a bilateral treaty between the UK and France: all articles published abroad in periodicals can be freely reprinted and translated, unless reserved rights are explicitly mentioned[8]
 \item 1869: Foundation of the British scientific journal Nature[9]
 \item 1880: Foundation of the Dutch publishing company Elsevier[10]
 \item 1886: Signature of the Berne Convention, an international agreement governing copyright. Its article 7 states: “Articles from newspapers or periodicals published
   in any of the countries of the Union may be reproduced in original or in translation in other countries of the Union, unless the authors or publishers have expressly forbidden it.” [11] In today’s parlance, the Berne Convention grants a CC BY licence by default.

 \item 1908: Berlin Act: revision of the Berne Convention. It reverses the standards: instead of being implicitly allowed, reproduction is now implicitly forbidden. Its article 9 states: “Serial stories, tales, and all other works, whether literary, scientific, or artistic, whatever their object, published in the newspapers or periodicals of one of the countries of the Union, may not be reproduced in the other countries without the consent of the authors.” The Berne convention has later been further updated, but this restriction remains. Most countries have now signed it [11].
 \item 1928: Rome Act: revision of the Berne Convention. The article 6bis states: “Independently of the author’s copyright, and even after transfer of the said copyright, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work, as well as the right to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the said work which would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation.”. This implements the moral rights of the authors, which is an essential feature of the author’s rights or droit d’auteur, as opposed to the copyright.
 \item Post-WWII: The budget dedicated to science increases enormously. For instance, the average yearly growth of the US federal budget dedicated to non-defense R\&D between 1953 and 1973 is more than 15\% [12].
 \item 1951: Robert Maxwell creates Pergamon Press. Academic journals used to be mainly owned by learned societies. Maxwell perceives the potential huge profitability of academic publishing as the public funding for research rises. He creates many new journals for specific fields of research and surfs on globalisation with grand titles like ‘International Journal of’. Pergamon Press is sold to Elsevier in 1991. [13]
 \item 1955: The idea of an impact factor is first mentioned by Eugene Garfield in Science. It was originally thought of as a tool for librarians to identify journals to purchase, not as a measure of the quality of research [14]. Since 1975, it has been computed and published in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), nowadays owned by Clarivate [15].
 \item 1970s: Beginning of the serials pricing crisis: the prices of subscriptions to scholarly journals rise tremendously. For instance, between 1973 and 1987, the average price increases by 12\% per year, while the costs for the publishers only rise increase by 8\% [16, p. 22]. This difference between expenses and revenue enables the publishers to make big margins. Librarians start to organise and fight back.
 \item 1991: Paul Ginsparg creates the free archive xxx.lanl.gov at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which will become arXiv.org 10 years later [17].
   \item 2000: Foundation of BioMed Central by Vitek Tracz. This publisher inaugurates a business model based on online open-access journals with an article processing charge (APC). It is now part of Springer Nature. [18]
 \item 2000: An online petition receives the signatures of nearly 34,000 scientists who claim “we will publish in, edit and review for, and personally subscribe to only those scholarly and scientific journals that have agreed to grant unrestricted free distribution rights to any and all original research reports.” The initiative soon takes the form of a non-profit named the Public Library of Science (PLoS). It creates its first open-access journal, PLOS Biology, in 2003. Initially, depending on external grants, it develops a business model based on article processing charges. [19]

 \item 2002: Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI). This landmark conference on the open access movement is organised by the Open Society Institute. It results in a public call to promote open access of scholarly literature, insisting on the need to remove all access fees for the readers, but it does not promote any particular model to cover the costs. [20]
 \item 2005: The Wellcome Trust, a British research foundation, starts requiring open access for the research they fund. [21]
 \item 2006: 50 million papers have been published since scholarly articles first appeared [ 5]. Over three centuries, the annual number of published articles has grown exponentially at a 3% rate.
 \item 2013: San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). It declares “Do not use journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors, as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles, to assess an individual scientist’s contributions, or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions.” The declaration is signed by more than 2400 organisations, including universities, funding agencies, and also publishers like Springer-Nature or Elsevier. [22]
 \item 2021: The Plan S requires scientific publications resulting from research funded by public grants to be published in compliant Open Access journals or platforms. It is supported by major institutions such as the World Health Organization, the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, the European Commission. [23]
